# haikus

A learning project to find haikus in Clojure

## What I've Learned Thus Far

* Side-effects and lazy evaluation don't mix. Wrap in a `doall` first.
* ActiveRecord-style libraries like korma have been deprecated in favor of fast SQL wrappers like Yessql
* The Lobos library provides DB migrations if I needed them
* [Environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ) seems to be the simplest way how to handle environment-specific DB settins
